<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
I wanted a project where I wouldn't have to focus on the vision, rather the technical components as a way to build my hard skills. For this, I picked out a simple website which I found interest in and decided to recreate it. This website of choice happened to be the NYU website. After careful work I 
created a version which is very close to the origional and with changes of my own that are only design related.

Based on: [NYU Website](https://www.nyu.edu/)



### Built With

I built the project entirely in React using Chakra UI as a component library. The project was created using Node Js and Vite aswell. This was all done using VS Code as the IDE of choice.







<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The functionality of the website included hover animations, text boxes, variable fonts, etc... all design aspects to mimic the origional website. This version, however, does not use functional routing so it does not bring you to any other pages but the home and links are not functional.
